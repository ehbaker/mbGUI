# How to Get a Local Copy of this Mass Balance GUI:

+ Open Git Bash (if you don't have it yet, [download](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)).
+ Use `cd` and tab-completion to move to the folder where you want to keep your local copy of this GUI.
  + If you want to put it on your desktop, navigate to your desktop (a folder called mbGUI will be created during clone).
  + The text in yellow gives your location; also typing `pwd` in the prompt will print your current location.
  + `..` means 'go up a directory'; from _c/Users/yourusername_, type `cd Desktop` to go to the desktop.
+ Clone the directory with `git clone https://github.com/ehbaker/mbGUI.git`
+ A new folder will appear titled *mbGUI* - this has all the files in this repository.
