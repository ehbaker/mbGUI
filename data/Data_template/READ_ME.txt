In this folder are explainations, examples, and formats of input data required to run the USGS Mass Balance Matlab code. 
Each input file name is structured for the code to find files based on the glacier name eg. '../data/Wolverine/Input_Wolverine_mb.txt'.
For each input file a brief explanation of the data and format can be found.
